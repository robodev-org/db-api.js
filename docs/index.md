## Structure

- Foundation: principles and non-negotiable constraints
- Architecture: runtime boundaries, diagnostics, and error model
- API: public contract and defaults
- Testing: diagnostics-first testing system
- Performance: budgets and policies
- Contributing: review and release standards
- Security: threat model and reporting
- Troubleshooting: diagnostics-driven debugging

## Reading order (recommended)

1) Foundation: philosophy, design principles, defaults-first, diagnostics-first, security model
2) Architecture: overview, runtime boundaries, error model, diagnostics model
3) API: public surface and invariants
4) Testing: diagnostics harness and mocks
5) Security: threat model and RLS boundaries
